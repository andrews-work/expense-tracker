## JavaScript Expertise

In developing this expense tracker app, I've showcased my proficiency in various aspects of JavaScript programming:

1. **Context API and State Management:**
   I've implemented the Context API to manage the global state of the app. This approach centralizes the state management, making it easier to share data and actions across components.

2. **Use of Reducers and Actions:**
   The app employs reducers and actions to modify the state. I've showcased my understanding of the unidirectional data flow principle by managing state changes through well-defined actions.

3. **Asynchronous Operations:**
   My use of the Fetch API to interact with the global state demonstrates my grasp of asynchronous programming concepts. I effectively handle the addition and removal of transactions asynchronously.

4. **Functional Components and Hooks:**
   The app exclusively uses functional components and leverages hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`. This emphasizes my familiarity with modern React practices.

5. **Conditional Rendering and Mapping:**
   I've employed conditional rendering to display positive and negative transactions differently, showcasing my ability to manage dynamic UI elements. Additionally, I've demonstrated my competence in mapping arrays of data to create lists of transactions.

6. **Data Manipulation and Formatting:**
   The app features functions to format currency values, reflecting my understanding of data manipulation and formatting techniques.
